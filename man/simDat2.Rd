\title{Simulated dataset for demonstration}
\format{
A data frame with 151 rows and 7 variables.
}
\usage{
data(simDat2)
}
\description{
A simulated data frame with the following variables
\describe{
  \item{id}{subjects identification}
  \item{t.start}{start of the interval}
  \item{t.stop}{endpoint of the interval; when time origin is 0 this variable also marks the recurrence or terminal/censoring time}
  \item{status}{terminal event indicator; 1 if a terminal event is recorded}
  \item{event}{recurrent event indicator; 1 if a recurrent event is recorded}
  \item{x1}{baseline covariate generated from a standard uniform distribution}
  \item{x2}{baseline covariate generated from a standard uniform distribution (independent from \code{z1}}
}
This simulated data has the same survival features as \code{simDat} except for
the subject-specified time origin.
}
\details{
The sample dataset \code{simDat2} is generated by \code{set.seed(7); simSC(30, c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), origin = 1:30)}.
See \code{\link{simSC}} for instruction on simulating recurrent event data from
scale-change models.
